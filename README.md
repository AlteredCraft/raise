## Purpose
This is an effort, similar to The Agile Manifesto (https://agilemanifesto.org/) to provide a community derived framework 
for utilizing AI in the software development process. 

We do not feel the extreams of [Zero use of AI in software develoment] OR [Vibe Coding with no review of code] are viable for software development.
